# Mini-Framework Development Project

This document outlines the steps and provides documentation to create your own mini-framework. The project is divided into several phases to ensure smooth progress and adherence to the specified requirements.

---

## Project To-Do List

### 1. **Set Up Project Environment**
- Create a new project directory.
- Initialize a Git repository for version control.
- Set up a basic folder structure:
  ```
  /project-root
  |-- /src
  |   |-- /core
  |   |-- /examples
  |-- /docs
  |-- index.html
  |-- app.js
  |-- styles.css
  ```
- Install tools for bundling (e.g., Webpack or Parcel) and set up Babel if needed for ES6+ compatibility.

### 2. **Abstracting the DOM**
- Implement functions for creating and manipulating DOM elements.
- Define a Virtual DOM system for efficient updates.
- Create methods for:
  - Adding attributes.
  - Nesting elements.
  - Handling events.
- Test DOM abstraction by creating simple elements programmatically.

### 3. **Routing System**
- Implement a router to synchronize URL changes with application state.
- Create functions to define routes and dynamically load content based on the current URL.
- Test routing by creating multiple pages and navigating between them.

### 4. **State Management**
- Implement a central store for managing the state.
- Create methods to:
  - Update state.
  - Subscribe to state changes.
  - Access the current state.
- Test state management by binding state changes to UI updates.

### 5. **Event Handling**
- Create a custom event handling system to manage user interactions.
- Implement event delegation for better performance.
- Test event handling by creating interactive components (e.g., buttons or forms).

### 6. **TodoMVC Example**
- Use the framework to create a functional TodoMVC application.
- Include features like:
  - Adding tasks.
  - Editing tasks.
  - Deleting tasks.
  - Marking tasks as complete/incomplete.
  - Filtering tasks.

### 7. **Documentation**
- Write detailed documentation for the framework.
- Include code examples for:
  - Creating elements.
  - Nesting elements.
  - Adding attributes.
  - Handling events.
- Provide an overview of the framework's architecture and design decisions.

### 8. **Testing and Debugging**
- Test the framework on different browsers and devices.
- Debug any issues and ensure compliance with project requirements.
